# This is `Tickle` ðŸ˜‚

## Actual Truth (I think...):
I don't *really* know what a static site generator is (I'm actually not sure if that's true, but let's roll with it). Is this what it is, sort of?

## I did this why, now?
I've used Jekyll a tiny, little, bit before and liked it a lot. But I didn't like not knowing what was going on underneath. I don't speak Ruby.

So it was either learn Ruby or write something in JavaScript (something about Ruby syntax bothers me -- I have no idea what or why). So I did some looking and reading and came across Marijn Haverbeke's [heckle](https://github.com/marijnh/heckle), a Jekyll clone written in JavaScript (Marijn Haverbeke is amazing).

âœ¨ Jackpot! âœ¨

Tickle is heckle adapted (_read: simplified_) for my own needs.
